#include "EncryptedArray.h"

//! @class EvalMap
//! @brief Class that provides the functionality for the 
//! linear transforms used in boostrapping.
//! The constructor is invoked with three arguments:
//!   - an EncryptedArray object ea
//!   - an integer vector mvec
//!   - a boolean flag invert
//! The mvec vector specifies the factorization of m
//! to use in the "powerful basis" decomposition.
//!
//! If the invert flag is false, the forward transformation is
//! used.  This transformation views the slots as being packed
//! with powerful-basis coefficients and performs a multi-point
//! polynomial evaluation.  This is the second transformation
//! used in bootstrapping.
//!
//! If invert flag is true, the inverse transformation is used.
//! In addition, the current implementation folds into the
//! inverse transformation a transformation that moves
//! the coefficients in each slot into a normal-basis representation,
//! which helps with the unpacking procedure.
//! 
//! The constructor precomputes certain values, but the linear
//! transformation itself is effected using the apply method.
//!
//! Note that the factorization in mvec must correspond to the
//! generators used in PAlgebra.  The best way to ensure this is
//! to used directly the output of the params program, which
//! will supply values for mvec (to be used here), and gens and ords
//! (to be used in initialize the FHEcontext).
